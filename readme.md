**Your answer:**
```app.js
(function(){
angular

})();

```

## Question 2

Given a custom directive whose `link` function contains the line:

```js
scope.status = "Click";
```

Which *one* of the following buttons would *not* be displayed?

```html
[ ] A: <button data-ng-if="status">Click</button>
[ ] B: <button data-ng-show="status">Click</button>
[X] C: <button data-ng-hide="status">Click</button>
[ ] D: <button>{{status}}</button>
```

## Question 3

One button below has an `ng-click` attribute; the other has `data-ng-click` instead. What difference does it make?

```html
<button ng-click="create()">Click</button>
<button data-ng-click="create()">Click</button>
```

**Your answer:**

> ...They are the same. ng-click seems to be preferred.

## Question 4

Which of the following demonstrates the best usage of `ng-app`? **Explain your answer.**

**Your answer:**

> ...A. The browser reads, html first top to bottom, so the first opportunity to send it to the IIFE in app.js is the better..

### A:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-ng-app="myapp">
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### B:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head data-ng-app="myapp">
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### C:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div data-ng-app="myapp"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Question 5

Imagine an app in which a change to the view updates the model without a page refresh, and a change to the model updates the view without a page refresh.

Which one of the following concepts does this best illustrate?

```
[ ] A: Modularity
[ ] B: MVC
[X] C: Two-way data-binding
[ ] D: Separation of concerns
```

## Question 6

What is an IIFE, and why might you use it?

**Your answer:**

> ...Immediately invoked function expression
>  Immediately-invoked function expressions can be used to avoid variable hoisting from within blocks, protect against polluting the global environment and simultaneously allow public access to methods while retaining privacy for variables defined within the function.

## Question 7

What is the `ui-sref` directive, and how is it used?

**Your answer:**

> ...A directive that binds a link (<a> tag) to a state. If the state has an associated URL, the directive will automatically generate & update the href attribute via the $state.href() method. Clicking the link will trigger a state transition with optional parameters. Also middle-clicking, right-clicking, and ctrl-clicking on the link will be handled natively by the browser.

## Question 8

One of the lines of code in the following snippet will throw an error. Which one is it, and why?

**Your answer:**

> ... I ran it. no errors. It's a clean and working fizzbuzz.
>

```js
/*1*/ "use strict";
/*2*/ var max = 100;
/*3*/ for(i = 1; i < max; i++){
/*4*/   if(i % 15 == 0) console.log("FizzBuzz");
/*5*/   else if(i % 3 == 0) console.log("Fizz");
/*6*/   else if(i % 5 == 0) console.log("Buzz");
/*7*/   else console.log(i);
/*8*/ }
```

## Question 9

Custom directives can be embedded in HTML four different ways. Demonstrate **two** of these four with a directive called `my-directive`. (Hint: "MACE")

**Your answer:**
```js
.myDirective('myCustomer', function() {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    templateUrl: 'my-customer.html'
  };
});

The restrict option is typically set to:

'A' - only matches attribute name
'E' - only matches element name
'C' - only matches class name
'M' - only matches comment
These restrictions can all be combined as needed:

'AEC' - matches either attribute or element or class name
```
